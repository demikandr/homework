acknowledgments  about the author
foreward
i didnt write a foreword to the original edition of a brief history of 
time that was done by carl sagan instead
i wrote a short piece titled acknowledgments in which i was advised to 
thank everyone some of the
foundations that had given me support werent too pleased to have been 
mentioned however because it led to
a great increase in applications
i dont think anyone my publishers my agent or myself expected the 
book to do anything like as well as it did
it was in the london sunday times bestseller list for  weeks longer 
than any other book apparently the
bible and shakespeare arent counted it has been translated into 
something like forty languages and has sold
about one copy for every  men women and children in the world as 
nathan myhrvold of microsoft a
former postdoc of mine remarked i have sold more books on physics 
than madonna has on sex
the success of a brief history indicates that there is widespread 
interest in the big questions like where did
we come from and why is the universe the way it is
i have taken the opportunity to update the book and include new 
theoretical and observational results obtained
since the book was first published on april fools day  i have 
included a new chapter on wormholes
and time travel einsteins general theory of relativity seems to offer 
the possibility that we could create and
maintain wormholes little tubes that connect different regions of 
spacetime if so we might be able to use
them for rapid travel around the galaxy or travel back in time of 
course we have not seen anyone from the

future or have we but i discuss a possible explanation for this
i also describe the progress that has been made recently in finding 
dualities or correspondences between
apparently different theories of physics these correspondences are a 
strong indication that there is a complete
unified theory of physics but they also suggest that it may not be 
possible to express this theory in a single
fundamental formulation instead we may have to use different 
reflections of the underlying theory in different
situations it might be like our being unable to represent the surface 
of the earth on a single map and having to
use different maps in different regions this would be a revolution in 
our view of the unification of the laws of
science but it would not change the most important point that the 
universe is governed by a set of rational laws
that we can discover and understand
on the observational side by far the most important development has 
been the measurement of fluctuations in
the cosmic microwave background radiation by cobe the cosmic background 
explorer satellite and other
collaborations these fluctuations are the fingerprints of creation 
tiny initial irregularities in the otherwise
smooth and uniform early universe that later grew into galaxies stars 
and all the structures we see around us
their form agrees with the predictions of the proposal that the universe 
has no boundaries or edges in the
imaginary time direction but further observations will be necessary to 
distinguish this proposal from other
possible explanations for the fluctuations in the background however 
within a few years we should know
whether we can believe that we live in a universe that is completely 
selfcontained and without beginning or
end
