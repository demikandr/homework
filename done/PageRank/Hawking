FOREWARD
I didn’t write a foreword to the original edition of A Brief History of 
Time. That was done by Carl Sagan. Instead,
I wrote a short piece titled “Acknowledgments” in which I was advised to 
thank everyone. Some of the
foundations that had given me support weren’t too pleased to have been 
mentioned, however, because it led to
a great increase in applications.
I don’t think anyone, my publishers, my agent, or myself, expected the 
book to do anything like as well as it did.
It was in the London Sunday Times best-seller list for 237 weeks, longer 
than any other book (apparently, the
Bible and Shakespeare aren’t counted). It has been translated into 
something like forty languages and has sold
about one copy for every 750 men, women, and children in the world. As 
Nathan Myhrvold of Microsoft (a
former post-doc of mine) remarked: I have sold more books on physics 
than Madonna has on sex.
The success of A Brief History indicates that there is widespread 
interest in the big questions like: Where did
we come from? And why is the universe the way it is?
I have taken the opportunity to update the book and include new 
theoretical and observational results obtained
since the book was first published (on April Fools’ Day, 1988). I have 
included a new chapter on wormholes
and time travel. Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity seems to offer 
the possibility that we could create and
maintain wormholes, little tubes that connect different regions of 
space-time. If so, we might be able to use
them for rapid travel around the galaxy or travel back in time. Of 
course, we have not seen anyone from the

future (or have we?) but I discuss a possible explanation for this.
I also describe the progress that has been made recently in finding 
“dualities” or correspondences between
apparently different theories of physics. These correspondences are a 
strong indication that there is a complete
unified theory of physics, but they also suggest that it may not be 
possible to express this theory in a single
fundamental formulation. Instead, we may have to use different 
reflections of the underlying theory in different
situations. It might be like our being unable to represent the surface 
of the earth on a single map and having to
use different maps in different regions. This would be a revolution in 
our view of the unification of the laws of
science but it would not change the most important point: that the 
universe is governed by a set of rational laws
that we can discover and understand.
On the observational side, by far the most important development has 
been the measurement of fluctuations in
the cosmic microwave background radiation by COBE (the Cosmic Background 
Explorer satellite) and other
collaborations. These fluctuations are the finger-prints of creation, 
tiny initial irregularities in the otherwise
smooth and uniform early universe that later grew into galaxies, stars, 
and all the structures we see around us.
Their form agrees with the predictions of the proposal that the universe 
has no boundaries or edges in the
imaginary time direction; but further observations will be necessary to 
distinguish this proposal from other
possible explanations for the fluctuations in the background. However, 
within a few years we should know
whether we can believe that we live in a universe that is completely 
self-contained and without beginning or
end.
